        <h2>About Fela</h2>
        <p>
          He started his musical studies in 1958 in London and later formed a
          band called Koola Lobitos. In 1963, Fela moved back to Nigeria, where
          he reformed his band before moving to Ghana in 1967, to reflect on his
          musical direction.

          Kuti pioneered the Afrobeat music genre, by mixing soul, jazz and
          traditional African rhythms. Kuti was a fierce human rights and
          political activist who dedicated his life to fighting inequality,
          injustice, and cultural imperialism through his music.

          Fela Kuti died on August 2, 1997, at the age of 58, in Lagos, Nigeria.
          Roughly 1 million people attended his funeral procession, which began
          at Tafawa Balewa Square and ended at Kuti's home, Kalakuta, in Ikeja,
          Nigeria, where he was laid to rest in the front yard.

        <p>
          We remember and celebrate the life of the doyenne of Afrobeat through
          his words, which undoubtedly left an indelible mark.

            1970 - After Fela and his band returned to Nigeria, the group was

            describe the methods of the Nigerian military. The album was a smash
            hit and infuriated the government, setting off a vicious attack
            against the Kalakuta Republic, during which one thousand soldiers
            attacked the commune. Fela was severely beaten, and his elderly
            mother (whose house was located opposite the commune) was thrown

            (reflecting his reading of pan-African literature) and continued to
            record albums and tour the country. He further infuriated the
            political establishment by dropping the names of ITT Corporation
            vice-president Moshood Abiola and then General Olusegun Obasanjo at
            the end of a hot-selling 25-minute political screed entitled "I.T.T.
            (International Thief-Thief)".
